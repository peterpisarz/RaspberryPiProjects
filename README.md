# Raspberry Pi Projects
## Independent Raspberry Pi Projects

These projects originated from a course offered by 42Electronics.

While much of the setup is identical, I have made significant independent changes adding to their complexity and user experience.

2 sample projects are provided in this Repository:

### ForLoop_4LED: 
- Code featuring a series of for-loops which iterate through output pins and flash an LED sequence
- Code, Video and Schematic (Fritzing) provided

### RFID:
- Code making use of an RFID reader to distiguish approved IDs
- System denies the "tag" and sends a PWM signal to a piezo buzzer for user feedback
- System approves the "card" and illuminates a blue LED for verification
- Code and Video provided
